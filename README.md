## **WEIGHT TRACKER APP**

### **ENHANCEMENT ONE: SOFTWARE DESIGN AND ENGINEERING**

This artifact best fit the Software Design and Engineering category in my ePortfolio.  The work done on this app consisted of design based on the needs of the target audience.  In order for the app to be readily available for more users I need to make sure that it can work on various platforms, even the older models.  Object oriented design principles were used to create Java classes that interacted with the XML files for the user interface (UI) layouts.  Functionality of the app includes date entry, weight entry, sign in, edit and delete buttons.  The following was my previous design.

Through the design and creation of the mobile application, we can showcase skills in software design and tailor it to the need of end user audience. The design of the app needs to be thoughtful and well-structured to follow standards and stay aligned with the goal of the app. The goal as mentioned before is to create a simple means to track weight.  The UI was enhanced because the previous model did not have a very appealing color scheme.  The following shows my improved UI.

The weight entry screen had an update to the theme and layout to make information easier to view.  In my previous model there was a glitch when displaying the inputs in the weight entry screen.  That issue was resolved and now the app displays the entries with the dates and weights.  When the enter date is selected, it will show a calendar to make it simpler for the user to input the date. 

The weight entry part of the app was improved by displaying all the entries so the user can plan accordingly for their weight goals.  My goal is to add a graph so that it can be more useful to users who tend to be more visual with their goals.

### FUTURE UPDATES

As of now, I am still trying to edit this app improve the design and add more functionality to the app. I did add more comments to the code so that it could be more readable on the backend. As a software designer and engineer there is always a way to upgrade code to bring more value to the user.
