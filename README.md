## **TOP 5 DESTINATIONS**

### **ENHANCEMENT TWO: ALGORITHMS AND DATA STRUCTURES**

Originally the project was part of CS 250 coursework, but the application underwent further development during Enhancement #2 of this CS 499 course. This project serves as a seamless integration of data structure management and user interface (UI) logic. I chose to include it in my ePortfolio for several reasons. The application employs a list data structure, specifically DefaultListModel and ArrayList, to efficiently manage the entries for each destination. This ensures organized and easily accessible data. Furthermore, TextAndIconListCellRenderer was implemented to format the text and scale the images. The result was a visually appealing display of information. The code incorporates algorithmic logic to determine which items should be displayed based on the current page, ensuring smooth navigation and data presentation.  Additionally, the application demonstrates my ability to design responsive and user-friendly interfaces, prioritizing style, layout, and content updates to enhance the user experience.

During the enhancement process, several improvements were made to enhance the applicationâ€™s functionality and user experience. Page labels and navigation buttons were added to make navigation easier and to clearly indicate the current page, improving user interaction. The user interface was styled with custom themes to enhance its visual appeal. Improved code readability was achieved by adding comments and clear structure. 
The project successfully achieved the desired outcomes outlined in Module One, which included designing software solutions using appropriate data structures to enhance user experience through GUI development and interface improvements.

Through the enhancement process, I developed an understanding of Swing GUI layouts, custom rendering, and responsive UI design. I acquired several skills including component-based logic, where I learned how to divide logic into manageable components. I discovered how to use HTML within Java Swing labels to support styled formatting, allowing for more visually appealing text display.
