## **GRAZIOSO SALVARE DASHBOARD**

### **ENHANCEMENT THREE: DATABASES**

The enhanced version of the artifact builds on the original by adding dynamic MongoDB queries that respond to user-selected filters while also removing problematic fields such as _id. The result was smoother data presentation and enhancement of the efficiency of database interactions. This project helped meet several key course objectives including developing data-driven applications, applying CRUD operations in a real-world environment, and designing user friendly software solutions backed by a real database. As far as the goals outlined in Module 1, the enhancements successfully achieved desired outcomes.

Through enhancing this artifact, I deepened my understanding of how front-end and back-end systems interact in a data centered application. I gained hands-on experience working with Dash callbacks, MongoDB queries, and data cleanup techniques. Some of the challenges I encountered included handling complex data like MongoDBâ€™s _id field to avoid front-end rendering issues, designing data filters that are both user friendly/efficient in execution, and debugging interactions between Dash components and dynamic database responses. Overall, this project contributed significantly to my growth as a developer by connecting database logic with the use of graphic visualization of data. 


### FUTURE UPDATES

In the future, I would like to translate this dashboard into mobile app format.  I plan on using Andoid Studio to create an intuitive, user friendly app to access the database with the rescue animals information.
