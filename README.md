## Course Outcomes


### **Course Outcome 1:**

Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making in the field of computer science

**Artifact: Grazioso Salvare Dashboard (Enhancement 3)**
In this project, I created a data dashboard that used animal rescue data to get information. I used MongoDB queries and Dash components to create real-time data filtering, which would help users find specific information quicker. The ability to build dashboards for accessible to different users demonstrates my ability to contribute to collaborative environments that need effective decision-making through accessible data.


### **Course Outcome 2:**

Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts

**Artifact: Top 5 Destinations App (Enhancement 2)**
This Java Swing-based Graphic User Interfaces (GUI) application was enhanced for better usability, visual appeal, and interface structure. I included labeled navigation, styled components, and informative text to better present the content to users. Additionally, documenting this project and presenting it in the ePortfolio required effective communication for both technical and non-technical audiences. This demonstrated my ability to design visual and written communication content to different audiences.


### **Course Outcome 3:**

Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices

**Artifact: Top 5 Destinations App (Enhancement 2)**
The use of data structures such as ArrayList and DefaultListModel  with custom rendering logic and page indexing, required careful consideration of algorithms and usability. I created logic to display only relevant content per page, creating efficient of memory use and interface accessibility. This reflects my ability to apply algorithmic principles and standards to create solutions refined to a defined problem space.


### **Course Outcome 4:**

Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals

**Artifact: Weight Tracker Mobile App (Enhancement 1)**
In this mobile application, I used Java, Android Studio, and SQL to create a functioning mobile weight tracker. I introduced enhancements such as calendar integration, improved UI layout, and data storage. These updates made the app more usable in real-world health tracking, aligning with best industry practices. The enhancement process demonstrated critical thinking and practical skills that align with mobile development standards.


### **Course Outcome 5:**

Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources

**Artifact: Weight Tracker Mobile App (Enhancement 1)**
Security considerations were part of the design choices in this application, particularly in how user data is stored and accessed. I considered data privacy when designing local storage using SQL and aimed to prevent unauthorized access through controlled input and access restrictions.  These design decisions reflect a security mindset.
