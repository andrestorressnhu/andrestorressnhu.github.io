<p><strong>Educational Overview:</strong> 	Completing the coursework for the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University and developing this ePortfolio have been essential in helping me identify my strengths, uncover my professional aspirations,
  
  and prepare to enter the workforce with confidence. The projects I’ve completed demonstrated my technical proficiency and reflects my growth as a collaborative problem solver and resourceful learner. This ePortfolio serves as the mountain top of that journey, 
  
  showcasing work that includes both technical competence and creative software design.
</p>
    
            <div class=" mt-5"></div>

<p><strong>CS Course Examples:</strong> Over the course of the program, I gained valuable experience collaborating within a team environment. In courses like CS 320, I participated in collaborative software development projects that followed Agile methodologies.
  
  These experiences required me to communicate effectively and contribute to modular, scalable codebases. Working closely with peers taught me how to seamlessly combine diverse ideas into solutions, highlighting the importance of team dynamics in project success.
  
  In addition to teamwork, the program also emphasized clear and effective communication with stakeholders. 
  
  For instance, in CS 250, I created user stories, mockups, and system requirements documentation, which simulated the process of gathering feedback and aligning technical solutions with user needs.
  
  This experience taught me how to present technical information in a professional manner to diverse audiences.  Software engineering and database development became another area of focus.
  
  In CS 340, I developed a data visualization dashboard that connected a Python frontend (using Dash) to a live MongoDB backend. This project introduced me to full-stack development concepts, real-time data handling, and user friendly interface design.
  
  Additionally, I learned how to model databases effectively, perform CRUD operations, and structure applications for scalability and maintainability.
</p>

<p><strong>Artifacts:</strong> 	The artifacts included in this ePortfolio serve as a diverse representation of my capabilities. The first artifact is a mobile weight tracking application developed using Java and Android Studio.
  
  This application demonstrates my proficiency in user interface design and mobile development. The second artifact is a Java-based desktop application that presents a list of travel destinations.
  
  This showcases my ability to work with graphical user interfaces, image rendering, and structured data presentation. The third artifact is a dynamic dashboard that connects to a live animal shelter database.
  
  This demonstrates my full-stack development skills and my ability to create interactive data applications.  These projects demonstrate how the knowledge and skills I’ve acquired throughout my Computer Science program support the development of sound, user friendly software.
  
  The ePortfolio not only highlights my individual achievements but also serves as a showcase of my readiness to contribute to real-world  projects.

            <p><strong>Description:</strong> The artifact in this section is a mobile app to track a person’s weight. This app keeps track of weight over time.  The app makes it convenient for the end user to see their progress towards a weight goal.  Android Studio was the integrated development environment (IDE) utilized to create this app. JAVA programming language was used to create the functionality of the app.  The Weight Tracker app was run and tested using a medium phone emulator on Android Studio IDE.</p>
            <p><strong>Enhancements:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Improved UI layout to be readable and visually appealing</li>
              <li>Resolved issues with glitch not allowing users to input weight data</li>
              <li>Enhanced data entry and added calendar input function</li>
